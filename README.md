# About:


This is a web app that allows users to play a virtual piano using their computer keyboard or mouse. 
It was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and can be run on any modern web browser.

The web app's user interface includes a virtual keyboard that mimics the look and feel of a real piano,
as well as buttons and sliders that allow users to adjust the tempo, change the key, and record and playback music.

Additionally, a new feature has been added to the web app: a button event that plays a pre-programmed melody when clicked. 
This button is located in the user interface and can be used to quickly play a pre-made melody without needing to manually play each note.

Overall, this web app provides a fun and interactive way for users to play and experiment with music, 
whether they are beginners or experienced musicians. 
Try it out and start playing beautiful music today!
